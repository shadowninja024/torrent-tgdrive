(Currently) 🤖 A Telegram Bot that can control your Aria2 server, control server files and also upload to OneDrive / Google Drive.

## 【NOTE】
Since the author I need to prepare for my graduate exams at the moment, the development progress will be appropriately stalled, but I think the idea of this program is very good, so I will keep developing.
Questions or suggestions are very welcome, and although I can't focus on development on my end, I still log in to GitHub often to check out everyone's suggestions and pr.😀

## Project significance
> The following is only a vision of what this program will look like when it is completed, the functions described so far are not fully implemented, please refer to the following [Functions realized](#functions-realized) for details of implementation

This project is mainly to use small hard disk server for offline downloading, for large BitTorrent files to be downloaded in sections according to the size of the hard disk, each time downloading a part, then uploading the network disk, delete and then download the other parts, until all the files are downloaded.

At the same time, communication via the bot protocol facilitates use on machines that cannot intranet penetration, and simplifies the usual use of download programs for added convenience.For links, sending a message directly to the Bot will directly identify and download them. It can actually delete files from the download folder, which is not possible with web panels such as AriaNG, and is very convenient as a tool for managing downloads and notifying timely completion of downloads. You can move files, and for users who mount their hard drives via rclone you can copy and paste directly through this program, without having to open an ssh connection to the VPS for `cp` operations, which is also very convenient.

#### Corresponding explanations
* aria2-server : Aria2 server address. Websocket connection is used by default. If you want to use websocket to connect to aria2, be sure to set `enable-rpc=true` in `aria2.conf`. If not necessary, please try to **set the local aria2 address**, in order to maximize the use of this program

* bot-key : ID of telegram Bot, get it by using [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather)

  ```jsonc
  {
    //···
    "user-id": "123456789,987654321,963852741",
    //···
  }
  ```
* max-index：Maximum display quantity of download information, 10 pieces are recommended (to be improved in the future)
* sign: Identification of this Bot, If multiple servers are required to connect to the same Bot, the specific server can be determined through this item.
* language: Language of Bot output
* downloadFolder: Aria2 download file save address.If you do not use this parameter, enter `""`
